A test app built for an interview. For viewing and testing purposes only.

You need to have node(https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and truffle(https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/installation) installed to run this app.

To run tests a ganache-cli needs to be running (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli).

Enable/Disable Metadata creation functionality is something I added for my own utility to help with the IPFS upload and off chain metadata creation.

To run the app:

cd into project directory and run "npm i" and then "npm start"
