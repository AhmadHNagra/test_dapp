A test app built for an interview. For viewing and testing purposes only

You need to have node and truffle installed to run this app.

To run tests a ganache-cli needs to be running

Enable/Disable Metadata creation functionality is something i added for my own utility to help with the IPFS upload and off chain metadata creation

To run the app:
cd into project directory and run "npm i" and then "npm start"
